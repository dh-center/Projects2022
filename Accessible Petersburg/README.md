# Accessible Petersburg Project

## Project Description
The “Accessible Petersburg” project is an information resource aimed at people with disabilities. It gathers the cultural institutions that work towards inclusiveness in one place. Future users will be able to prepare in advance and independently organise a trip to the museum, learn about the accessible programs that are held there.


## Usage

In terms of interface, the project consists of three parts.

### Museums

On this page the user will see a list of cultural institutions that are adapted for people with special needs. Each museum's card displays its name, address, nearby metro station, and two tags: accessible environment and events. The first tag appears if the institution has created a barrier-free environment for visiting, while the second tag reflects the number of inclusive programs that the museum is currently implementing. Part of the interface of the main page is shown in the figure 1.

The user can click on the card and go to the museum page. Here the user will see three sections: contact information (figure 2), information to prepare for the visit (figure 3), and a list of events (figure 4).

### Map

A map is another way of presenting a list of institutions. This section will be more useful for people without visual impairment, since reading Google Maps by screen readers is still difficult. From this page, the user will also be able to go to the page of the museum. The implemented map is shown in the figure 5.

### Contact form

This page is needed for users to contribute to the project. For example, if a cultural institution wants to share information on an inclusive program they run, they can send information here. Since the project is non-commercial, the contribution of enthusiasts will allow the project to grow faster. Contact form is shown below in the figure 6.
